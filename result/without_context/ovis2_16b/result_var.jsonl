Then, carefully pull out the blower unit (R). Next, rotate the blower unit counterclockwise 180 degrees (B). After that, reroute the wires through the grooves on the other side of the blower unit (D). Roll the blower unit 90 degrees so that the fan blade openings are facing out the back of the microwave (A). Place the blower unit back into the opening with the fan blade openings facing back (Y). Secure the blower unit to the microwave with the screw from Step 1 (S). Finally, ensure the damper hinge is installed correctly (E).
