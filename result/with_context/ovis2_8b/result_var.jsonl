Next, carefully pull out the blower unit (A), rotate it 90\u00b0 so that the fan blade openings are facing out the back of the microwave (B), reroute the wires through grooves on the other side of the blower unit (D), roll the blower unit 90\u00b0 so that the fan blade openings are facing the back of the microwave (R), place the blower unit back into the opening with the fan blade openings facing back (Y), secure the blower unit to the microwave with the screw from Step 1 (S), and finally, push in securely until it is in the lower locking tabs (E). This sequence ensures proper installation and functionality of the blower unit."}, "ground_truth": "B"}
